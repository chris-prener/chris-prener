I am an urban and medical sociologist at <a href="http://slu.edu" target="_blank">Saint Louis University</a> in St. Louis, MO. My academic work spans a number of topics, including urban emergency medical services, neighborhood disorder, segregation, and poor physical and mental health outcomes. I work primarily in the programming language `R` and with desktop GIS tools including QGIS. I am the developer of a number of `R` packages, with a focus on working with spatial data and making data about the St. Louis area more accessible.
